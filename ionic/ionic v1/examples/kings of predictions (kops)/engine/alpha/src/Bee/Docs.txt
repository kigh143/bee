_errors
	The errors scent can only be smelt at the root of the nector and therefore has no effect
in the reset of the nector
	It must be an array, if you have provided any nodeValue that is not an empty array, well it doesnot
acctuall matter because all that is needed is that this scent appears at the root of your nector


combs
	combs can be defined using singulars and plurals
bee supports a mixture of these but its highly recommended that one stocks to one style
in the hive definition
	One can define a comb as Categories and yet in the nector this can be referred to as Category
	Comb names use this culture "en-US"


HoneyTypes
pk     =>[int] IDENTITY(1,1) NOT NULL
int	   =>[int] NOT NULL
dbl    =>[float] NOT NULL
str    =>[nvarchar](max) NOT NULL
dte    =>[datetime] NOT NULL
enm    =>[int] NOT NULL
bol    =>[bit] NOT NULL
fk     =>[int] NOT NULL
inv_ an invisible cell, its put before a honey type to make it invisible
[DataType]_   => an underscore after a honey type makes it nullable e.g int_ => [int] NULL


//immediate attribute values dont apply in select or get scenarios because
//this is a select and it doesnt make scence for a cell to have a value
//which is not from the hive instead we use things like dynamic cells e.g +Token 

infuture please include an ability lkie this one _whfjfjfj: 45, 
                                                 _whfjfjfj: "343"

is it necessary to refer to parent nodes above like _$$$, because it tkink that since
the where cluse is one sentence then every object can just refer to its selft via _$
