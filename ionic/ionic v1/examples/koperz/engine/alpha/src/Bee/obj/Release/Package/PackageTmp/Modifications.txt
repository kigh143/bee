fixed an issue with _a:"* +something"
it was interpreting the statmen the right, as in it was not seeing that 
you have requested for everything e.g
else if (attributeFilter.Contains(Bee.Scents.Everything) && attributeFilter.Contains(Bee.Scents.Plus))
{
    attr = attr + " " + cell.Name;
}
this is done after we have determined that this cell.Name is not supposed to be removed, the detemination
is done by the if conditions above this one

Added
added a new engine jelly function called comma
takes up a number to be formated using commas 
_jstrPriceX:"comma Price"  ===> _jstrPriceX : "67,000"

Hive.GetAttributes
modified logic to scan for -ACellName
e.g
(attributeFilter.Contains(Bee.Scents.Minus + cell.Name + " ") || attributeFilter.EndsWith(Bee.Scents.Minus + cell.Name)
logic like this deals with cases like "-CakePot CakeX -Cake"
if the cell.Name = "Cake", without the + " " 
it would math -CakePot which is not the intended behviour
